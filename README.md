# Alegra SDK - Unofficial PHP Library for Alegra Services

This library offers easy interaction with the Alegra Servicios API.

Constant updates will be made to cover all the services Alegra offers, however, it is currently only functional:

1. Billing
2. Products and services
3. Contacts

Alegra-SDK offers a table called alegra_logs where you can find everything related to communication, errors, responses and more.

To use with Laravel, be sure to use the following commands:

1. php artisan migrate
2. php artisan vendor: publish --tag = "alegra-sdk-config"

We will continue working ...
